# Hangry No Mas

Hangry No Mas is an interactive restaurant decision-making game that searches by zip code and meal of choice (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks or cuisine), places options on a spinning wheel and allows the user to "spin" the wheel. 
After pressing "spin", the wheel returns a random choice and congratulations the user on making a decision. 
The user is also allowed to play again, which returns to the initial screen of collecting choice preferences. 


## Problem

Foodies / restaurant go-ers spend far too much time deliberating over where to eat. 
The pressure and time lost over making a simple decision as where to eat is an issue. 

## Hypothesis
If we provide an interactive, easy-to-use spinning wheel that chooses a restaurant for the user then prevent time lost during the day because users would rather spend time doing other activities than deciding where to eat.
